# VideoTitle
# These are the process for generating a title and even an abstract for video clips.


1. VideoFrames file split each video to its frames.

2. For the captioning process you might implement this repository https://github.com/ruotianluo/self-critical.pytorch 
Which is based on self-critical.pytorch. Thank you Ruotian for the code and your support!

3. Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-text-summarization-and-create-your-own-summarizer-in-python-b26a9f09fc70.
TxtSummary file is for text summariation process.

4. For making an abstract we used abstractive text summarization algorithm https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-abstractive-text-summarization-with-pretrained-t5-text-to-text-transfer-transformer-10f6d602c426.
